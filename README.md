# Creative-Coding-with-Basil.js

[Basil.js](http://basiljs.ch/) seems an abandoned project and is a shame because it could have become a tool of great potential.

Even if it is quickly becoming obsolete, it's still possible to get out something good (if you have a lot of patience).

This repository brings together everything that is still available on GitHub.
